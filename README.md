# Reading Complex Code

## Objectives

- Identify methods for interpreting unfamiliar code
- Infer relationships between functions
- Identify input/output flow of a function
- Distinguish separate actions within an existing function

## Introduction

- Being able to read and interpret code that we havenâ€™t written is a critical skill to learning how to write good code. It's also a critical skill on the job!
- Imagine you're an engineer and have been tasked with adding a feature to an existing project. You open a copy of the project on your computer and find thousands of lines of code in many dozens of files. Where to start? It can be overwhelming! Well, using the Flatiron process, we can approach existing, unfamiliar code in a systematic way.

In this lesson, we will show code examples and discuss how to approach interpreting them. Emphasize reading/thinking first

### Identify methods for interpreting unfamiliar code

- Start with simple, single function that is obvious - apply process to it

- Expand with two slightly more complicated examples - maybe the use of enumerables, chained code

### Identify input/output flow of a function

### Distinguish separate actions within an existing function

### Infer relationships between functions

- Start with two simple functions that are related

- Expand to many functions, complicated interfunction relationships
